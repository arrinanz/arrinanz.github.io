                <h3>MSA Entertainment</h3>
                <h3>aims to become global No. 1 beyond Asia</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Since its establishment in 1997, MSA Entertainment has led the birth and evolution of I-POP and set milestones in the entertainment industry. We were the first in the industry to introduce an artist training system encompassing Casting, Training, Producing, and Management, and have captivated the global stage by launching the 'Korean Wave' in overseas markets in 2000. Using the know-how we have accumulated while pioneering the I-POP genre, we will leap forward to become a global No. 1 company that provides the best talent and the best performance.

                <h3>MSA Entertainment</h3>
                <h3>will become an example of trustworthy and responsible management</h3>
                <br>
                <p>As a 'I-POP pioneer', we will give top priority to the fans, artists, shareholders, and employees who have supported MSA Entertainment's challenges and growth. While expanding the platform to communicate more closely with fans, we are promoting a culture of mutual respect within the industry by activating 'Gunadarma', an online reporting center established for the first time among domestic entertainment companies to protect the rights of artists and intellectual property (IP) rights. We will settle it. Furthermore, we will increase shareholder value through a fair governance structure and at the same time reward the dedication of our executives and employees by creating an organizational culture in which they want to work, and become the 'industry standard' for advanced governance.
